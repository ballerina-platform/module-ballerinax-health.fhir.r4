# FHIR NotifiableDiseasesNotified resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Additional notes or commentary about the communication by the sender, receiver or other interested parties.
# + partOf - Part of this action.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + subject - The patient or group that was the focus of this communication.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + about - Other resources that pertain to this communication and to which this communication should be associated.
# + reasonReference - Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this communication.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + medium - A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).
# + instantiatesUri - The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Communication.
# + statusReason - Captures the reason for the current state of the Communication.
# + payload - Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) that was communicated to the recipient.
# + inResponseTo - Prior communication that this communication is in response to.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - The reason or justification for the communication.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + basedOn - An order, proposal or plan fulfilled in whole or in part by this Communication.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this communication by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + received - The time when this communication arrived at the destination.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this Communication was created or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + instantiatesCanonical - The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Communication.
# + priority - Characterizes how quickly the planned or in progress communication must be addressed. Includes concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.
# + sent - reason(s) why this should be supported.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + sender - The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device) which was the source of the communication.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + recipient - The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, care team or device) which was the target of the communication. If receipts need to be tracked by an individual, a separate resource instance will need to be created for each recipient. Multiple recipient communications are intended where either receipts are not tracked (e.g. a mass mail-out) or a receipt is captured in aggregate (all emails confirmed received by a particular time).
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + topic - Description of the purpose/content, similar to a subject line in an email.
# + category - The type of message conveyed such as alert, notification, reminder, instruction, etc.
# + status - The status of the transmission.
