# FHIR Prescriptions resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + insurance - Insurance plans, coverage extensions, pre-authorizations and/or pre-determinations that may be required for delivering the requested service.
# + note - reason(s) why this should be supported.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + substitution - Indicates whether or not substitution can or should be part of the dispense. In some cases, substitution must happen, in other cases substitution must not happen. This block explains the prescriber's intent. If nothing is specified substitution may be done.
# + courseOfTherapyType - The description of the overall patte3rn of the administration of the medication to the patient.
# + priorPrescription - A link to a resource representing an earlier order related order or prescription.
# + subject - A link to a resource representing the person or set of individuals to whom the medication will be given.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - Condition or observation that supports why the medication was ordered.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + instantiatesUri - The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this MedicationRequest.
# + reportedReference - Indicates if this record was captured as a secondary 'reported' record rather than as an original primary source-of-truth record. It may also indicate the source of the report.
# + statusReason - Captures the reason for the current state of the MedicationRequest.
# + dispenseRequest - Indicates the specific details for the dispense or medication supply part of a medication request (also known as a Medication Prescription or Medication Order). Note that this information is not always sent with the order. There may be in some settings (e.g. hospitals) institutional or system support for completing the dispense details in the pharmacy department.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - The reason or the indication for ordering or not ordering the medication.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + doNotPerform - If true indicates that the provider is asking for the medication request not to occur.
# + basedOn - A plan or request that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this medication request.
# + requester - reason(s) why this should be supported.
# + identifier - Identifiers associated with this medication request that are defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate. They are business identifiers assigned to this resource by the performer or other systems and remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# * identifier Slicings
# 1) PrescriptionsIdentifierPrescriptionID: External ids for this request
#       - min = 1
#       - max = 1
#
# + recorder - reason(s) why this should be supported.
# + reportedBoolean - Indicates if this record was captured as a secondary 'reported' record rather than as an original primary source-of-truth record. It may also indicate the source of the report.
# + authoredOn - The date (and perhaps time) when the prescription was initially written or authored on.
# + performer - reason(s) why this should be supported.
# + detectedIssue - Indicates an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. Drug-drug interaction, duplicate therapy, dosage alert etc.
# + supportingInformation - Include additional information (for example, patient height and weight) that supports the ordering of the medication.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this [x] was created or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + instantiatesCanonical - The URL pointing to a protocol, guideline, orderset, or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this MedicationRequest.
# + medicationCodeableConcept - Identifies the medication being requested. This is a link to a resource that represents the medication which may be the details of the medication or simply an attribute carrying a code that identifies the medication from a known list of medications.
# + priority - Indicates how quickly the Medication Request should be addressed with respect to other requests.
# + intent - Whether the request is a proposal, plan, or an original order.
# + performerType - Indicates the type of performer of the administration of the medication.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + dosageInstruction - Indicates how the medication is to be used by the patient.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + eventHistory - Links to Provenance records for past versions of this resource or fulfilling request or event resources that identify key state transitions or updates that are likely to be relevant to a user looking at the current version of the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + category - Indicates the type of medication request (for example, where the medication is expected to be consumed or administered (i.e. inpatient or outpatient)).
# + groupIdentifier - A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the requisition or prescription.
# + status - A code specifying the current state of the order. Generally, this will be active or completed state.

# + performer - Indicates the intended dispensing Organization specified by the prescriber.
# + quantity - reason(s) why this should be supported.
# + numberOfRepeatsAllowed - An integer indicating the number of times, in addition to the original dispense, (aka refills or repeats) that the patient can receive the prescribed medication. Usage Notes: This integer does not include the original order dispense. This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus '3 repeats', then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient can receive a total of 120 tablets. A prescriber may explicitly say that zero refills are permitted after the initial dispense.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + initialFill - Indicates the quantity or duration for the first dispense of the medication.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + expectedSupplyDuration - Identifies the period time over which the supplied product is expected to be used, or the length of time the dispense is expected to last.
