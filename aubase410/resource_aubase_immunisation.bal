# FHIR AUBaseImmunisation resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Extra information about the immunization that is not conveyed by the other attributes.
# + primarySource - An indication that the content of the record is based on information from the person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the data was originally recorded.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + education - Educational material presented to the patient (or guardian) at the time of vaccine administration.
# + doseQuantity - The quantity of vaccine product that was administered.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - Condition, Observation or DiagnosticReport that supports why the immunization was administered.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + manufacturer - Physical vaccine product manufacturer.
# + programEligibility - Indicates a patient's eligibility for a funding program.
# + statusReason - Indicates the reason the immunization event was not performed.
# + isSubpotent - Indication if a dose is considered to be subpotent. By default, a dose should be considered to be potent.
# + patient - The patient who either received or did not receive the immunization.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - Reasons why the vaccine was administered.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + vaccineCode - Vaccine that was administered or was to be administered.
# + expirationDate - Date vaccine batch expires.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.
# + performer - Indicates who performed the immunization event.
# + reaction - Categorical data indicating that an adverse event is associated in time to an immunization.
# + subpotentReason - Reason why a dose is considered to be subpotent.
# + encounter - The visit or admission or other contact between patient and health care provider the immunization was performed as part of.
# + lotNumber - Lot number of the vaccine product.
# + recorded - The date the occurrence of the immunization was first captured in the record - potentially significantly after the occurrence of the event.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + site - Body site where vaccine was administered.
# + route - The path by which the vaccine product is taken into the body.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + protocolApplied - The protocol (set of recommendations) being followed by the provider who administered the dose.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + reportOrigin - The source of the data when the report of the immunization event is not based on information from the person who administered the vaccine.
# + location - The service delivery location where the vaccine administration occurred.
# + occurrenceDateTime - Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.
# + occurrenceString - Date vaccine administered or was to be administered.
# + fundingSource - Indicates the source of the vaccine actually administered. This may be different than the patient eligibility (e.g. the patient may be eligible for a publically purchased vaccine but due to inventory issues, vaccine purchased with private funds was actually administered).
# + status - Indicates the current status of the immunization event.
