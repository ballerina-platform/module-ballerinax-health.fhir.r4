# FHIR AUBaseAllergyIntolerance resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Additional narrative about the propensity for the Adverse Reaction, not captured in other fields.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a negated/excluded statement). This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., 'Latex'), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., 'Latex allergy'), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., 'No latex allergy') or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g., 'No known allergy', 'No known drug allergies'). Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'. If a receiving system is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.
# + onsetRange - Estimated or actual date, date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was identified.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + criticality - Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to the identified substance.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + clinicalStatus - The clinical status of the allergy or intolerance.
# + onsetDateTime - Estimated or actual date, date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was identified.
# + 'type - Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction risk.
# + onsetString - Estimated or actual date, date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was identified.
# + onsetAge - Estimated or actual date, date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was identified.
# + lastOccurrence - Represents the date and/or time of the last known occurrence of a reaction event.
# + patient - The patient who has the allergy or intolerance.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this AllergyIntolerance by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + recorder - Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.
# + onsetPeriod - Estimated or actual date, date-time, or age when allergy or intolerance was identified.
# + reaction - Details about each adverse reaction event linked to exposure to the identified substance.
# + verificationStatus - Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential risk, of a reaction to the identified substance (including pharmaceutical product).
# + recordedDate - The recordedDate represents when this particular AllergyIntolerance record was created in the system, which is often a system-generated date.
# + encounter - The encounter when the allergy or intolerance was asserted.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + asserter - The source of the information about the allergy that is recorded.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + category - Category of the identified substance.
