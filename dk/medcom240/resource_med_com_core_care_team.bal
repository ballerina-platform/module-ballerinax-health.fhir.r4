# FHIR MedComCoreCareTeam resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this care team by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + note - Comments made about the CareTeam.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + period - Indicates when the team did (or is intended to) come into effect and end.
# + subject - Identifies the patient or group whose intended care is handled by the team.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - Condition(s) that this care team addresses.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this CareTeam was created or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + participant - Identifies all people and organizations who are expected to be involved in the care team.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + managingOrganization - The organization responsible for the care team.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + name - A label for human use intended to distinguish like teams. E.g. the 'red' vs. 'green' trauma teams.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + telecom - A central contact detail for the care team (that applies to all members).
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - Describes why the care team exists.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + category - Identifies what kind of team. This is to support differentiation between multiple co-existing teams, such as care plan team, episode of care team, longitudinal care team.
# + status - Indicates the current state of the care team.
