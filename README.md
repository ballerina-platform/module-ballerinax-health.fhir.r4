## Building from the source

### Setting up the prerequisites

1. Download and install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 11. You can install either [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

    > **Note:** Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path name of the directory into which you installed JDK.

2. Download and install [Ballerina Swan Lake](https://ballerina.io/). 

### Building the source

Execute the commands below to build from the source.

- To build the package (eg - to build the uscore package):
    ```shell
    bal pack ./uscore501
    ```
- To build the FHIR service:
    - Navigate to `fhirr4` and run the following command
    
    ```shell
    mvn clean install
    ```
- To publish fhirservice packages, navigate to the `fhirr4/ballerina/target/classes/fhirservice` directory and run the Ballerina push command
    - To the Ballerina central 
    ```shell
    bal push
    ```
    
    - To the local repository
    ```shell
    bal push --repository=local
    ```

    Note: FHIR service uses some Ballerina language Java dependencies available as Github packages. To access them during the build, it requires an [access token from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages)  with the scope `read:packages`. Hence add the below server config to your Maven's settings.xml file located under `<M2_Home>/confs/` directory.
    ```shell
      <servers>
        . . .

        <server>
            <id>ballerina-language-repo</id>
            <username>Github_user_name</username>
            <password>Github_personal_access_token</password>
        </server>
      <servers>
    ```
