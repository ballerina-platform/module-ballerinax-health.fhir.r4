# FHIR USCoreCarePlanProfile resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - General notes about the care plan not covered elsewhere.
# + partOf - A larger care plan of which this particular care plan is a component or step.
# + addresses - Identifies the conditions/problems/concerns/diagnoses/etc. whose management and/or mitigation are handled by this plan.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + activity - Identifies a planned action to occur as part of the plan. For example, a medication to be used, lab tests to perform, self-monitoring, education, etc.
# + subject - Who care plan is for.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + description - A description of the scope and nature of the plan.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + title - Human-friendly name for the care plan.
# + instantiatesUri - The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, questionnaire or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this CarePlan.
# + contributor - Identifies the individual(s) or organization who provided the contents of the care plan.
# + supportingInfo - Identifies portions of the patient's record that specifically influenced the formation of the plan. These might include comorbidities, recent procedures, limitations, recent assessments, etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + basedOn - A care plan that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this care plan.
# + careTeam - Identifies all people and organizations who are expected to be involved in the care envisioned by this plan.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this care plan by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + period - Indicates when the plan did (or is intended to) come into effect and end.
# + goal - Describes the intended objective(s) of carrying out the care plan.
# + author - When populated, the author is responsible for the care plan. The care plan is attributed to the author.
# + created - Represents when this particular CarePlan record was created in the system, which is often a system-generated date.
# + replaces - Completed or terminated care plan whose function is taken by this new care plan.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this CarePlan was created or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + instantiatesCanonical - The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, questionnaire or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this CarePlan.
# + intent - Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the care plan and where the care plan fits into the workflow chain.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + category - Type of plan.
# + status - Indicates whether the plan is currently being acted upon, represents future intentions or is now a historical record.

To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - Detailed description of the type of planned activity; e.g. what lab test, what procedure, what kind of encounter.
# + goal - Internal reference that identifies the goals that this activity is intended to contribute towards meeting.
# + performer - Identifies who's expected to be involved in the activity.
# + quantity - Identifies the quantity expected to be supplied, administered or consumed by the subject.
# + kind - A description of the kind of resource the in-line definition of a care plan activity is representing. The CarePlan.activity.detail is an in-line definition when a resource is not referenced using CarePlan.activity.reference. For example, a MedicationRequest, a ServiceRequest, or a CommunicationRequest.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + description - This provides a textual description of constraints on the intended activity occurrence, including relation to other activities. It may also include objectives, pre-conditions and end-conditions. Finally, it may convey specifics about the activity such as body site, method, route, etc.
# + productReference - Identifies the food, drug or other product to be consumed or supplied in the activity.
# + reasonReference - Indicates another resource, such as the health condition(s), whose existence justifies this request and drove the inclusion of this particular activity as part of the plan.
# + instantiatesCanonical - The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, questionnaire or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this CarePlan activity.
# + instantiatesUri - The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, questionnaire or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this CarePlan activity.
# + scheduledString - The period, timing or frequency upon which the described activity is to occur.
# + statusReason - Provides reason why the activity isn't yet started, is on hold, was cancelled, etc.
# + scheduledTiming - The period, timing or frequency upon which the described activity is to occur.
# + scheduledPeriod - The period, timing or frequency upon which the described activity is to occur.
# + dailyAmount - Identifies the quantity expected to be consumed in a given day.
# + location - Identifies the facility where the activity will occur; e.g. home, hospital, specific clinic, etc.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + reasonCode - Provides the rationale that drove the inclusion of this particular activity as part of the plan or the reason why the activity was prohibited.
# + doNotPerform - If true, indicates that the described activity is one that must NOT be engaged in when following the plan. If false, or missing, indicates that the described activity is one that should be engaged in when following the plan.
# + productCodeableConcept - Identifies the food, drug or other product to be consumed or supplied in the activity.
# + status - Identifies what progress is being made for the specific activity.
