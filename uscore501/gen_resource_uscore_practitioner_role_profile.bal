# FHIR USCorePractitionerRoleProfile resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - Business Identifiers that are specific to a role/location.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + period - The period during which the person is authorized to act as a practitioner in these role(s) for the organization.
# + specialty - Specific specialty of the practitioner.
# + code - Roles which this practitioner is authorized to perform for the organization.
# + practitioner - Practitioner that is able to provide the defined services for the organization.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + active - Whether this practitioner role record is in active use.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + notAvailable - The practitioner is not available or performing this role during this period of time due to the provided reason.
# + availableTime - A collection of times the practitioner is available or performing this role at the location and/or healthcareservice.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + endpoint - Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the practitioner with this role.
# + healthcareService - The list of healthcare services that this worker provides for this role's Organization/Location(s).
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + organization - The organization where the Practitioner performs the roles associated.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + location - The location(s) at which this practitioner provides care.
# + telecom - Contact details that are specific to the role/location/service.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + availabilityExceptions - A description of site availability exceptions, e.g. public holiday availability. Succinctly describing all possible exceptions to normal site availability as details in the available Times and not available Times.
