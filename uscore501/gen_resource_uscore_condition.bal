# FHIR USCoreCondition resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Additional information about the Condition. This is a general notes/comments entry for description of the Condition, its diagnosis and prognosis.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - Identification of the condition, problem or diagnosis.
# + evidence - Supporting evidence / manifestations that are the basis of the Condition's verification status, such as evidence that confirmed or refuted the condition.
# + onsetRange - Estimated or actual date or date-time the condition began, in the opinion of the clinician.
# + abatementDateTime - The date or estimated date that the condition resolved or went into remission. This is called 'abatement' because of the many overloaded connotations associated with 'remission' or 'resolution' - Conditions are never really resolved, but they can abate.
# + subject - Indicates the patient or group who the condition record is associated with.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + clinicalStatus - The clinical status of the condition.
# + onsetDateTime - Estimated or actual date or date-time the condition began, in the opinion of the clinician.
# + onsetString - Estimated or actual date or date-time the condition began, in the opinion of the clinician.
# + onsetAge - Estimated or actual date or date-time the condition began, in the opinion of the clinician.
# + abatementPeriod - The date or estimated date that the condition resolved or went into remission. This is called 'abatement' because of the many overloaded connotations associated with 'remission' or 'resolution' - Conditions are never really resolved, but they can abate.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + abatementString - The date or estimated date that the condition resolved or went into remission. This is called 'abatement' because of the many overloaded connotations associated with 'remission' or 'resolution' - Conditions are never really resolved, but they can abate.
# + severity - A subjective assessment of the severity of the condition as evaluated by the clinician.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this condition by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + recorder - Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.
# + onsetPeriod - Estimated or actual date or date-time the condition began, in the opinion of the clinician.
# + verificationStatus - The verification status to support the clinical status of the condition.
# + recordedDate - The recordedDate represents when this particular Condition record was created in the system, which is often a system-generated date.
# + abatementRange - The date or estimated date that the condition resolved or went into remission. This is called 'abatement' because of the many overloaded connotations associated with 'remission' or 'resolution' - Conditions are never really resolved, but they can abate.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this Condition was created or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + bodySite - The anatomical location where this condition manifests itself.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + asserter - Individual who is making the condition statement.
# + stage - Clinical stage or grade of a condition. May include formal severity assessments.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + category - A category assigned to the condition.
# + abatementAge - The date or estimated date that the condition resolved or went into remission. This is called 'abatement' because of the many overloaded connotations associated with 'remission' or 'resolution' - Conditions are never really resolved, but they can abate.
