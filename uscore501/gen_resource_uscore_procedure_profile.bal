public const RESOURCE_NAME_USCOREPROCEDUREPROFILE = "Procedure";

# FHIR USCoreProcedureProfile resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Any other notes and comments about the procedure.
# + partOf - A larger event of which this particular procedure is a component or step.
# + complication - Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate post-performance period. These are generally tracked separately from the notes, which will typically describe the procedure itself rather than any 'post procedure' issues.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - The specific procedure that is performed. Use text if the exact nature of the procedure cannot be coded (e.g. 'Laparoscopic Appendectomy').
# + subject - The person, animal or group on which the procedure was performed.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - The justification of why the procedure was performed.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + instantiatesUri - The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, order set or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Procedure.
# + performedPeriod - Estimated or actual date, date-time, period, or age when the procedure was performed. Allows a period to support complex procedures that span more than one date, and also allows for the length of the procedure to be captured.
# + followUp - If the procedure required specific follow up - e.g. removal of sutures. The follow up may be represented as a simple note or could potentially be more complex, in which case the CarePlan resource can be used.
# + statusReason - Captures the reason for the current state of the procedure.
# + usedCode - Identifies coded items that were used as part of the procedure.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - The coded reason why the procedure was performed. This may be a coded entity of some type, or may simply be present as text.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + performedDateTime - Estimated or actual date, date-time, period, or age when the procedure was performed. Allows a period to support complex procedures that span more than one date, and also allows for the length of the procedure to be captured.
# + basedOn - A reference to a resource that contains details of the request for this procedure.
# + outcome - The outcome of the procedure - did it resolve the reasons for the procedure being performed?
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this procedure by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and is propagated from server to server.
# + recorder - Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.
# + complicationDetail - Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate post-performance period.
# + performer - Limited to 'real' people rather than equipment.
# + usedReference - Identifies medications, devices and any other substance used as part of the procedure.
# + focalDevice - A device that is implanted, removed or otherwise manipulated (calibration, battery replacement, fitting a prosthesis, attaching a wound-vac, etc.) as a focal portion of the Procedure.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this Procedure was created or performed or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + instantiatesCanonical - The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, order set or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Procedure.
# + bodySite - Detailed and structured anatomical location information. Multiple locations are allowed - e.g. multiple punch biopsies of a lesion.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + asserter - Individual who is making the procedure statement.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + report - This could be a histology result, pathology report, surgical report, etc.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + location - The location where the procedure actually happened. E.g. a newborn at home, a tracheostomy at a restaurant.
# + category - A code that classifies the procedure for searching, sorting and display purposes (e.g. 'Surgical Procedure').
# + status - A code specifying the state of the procedure. Generally, this will be the in-progress or completed state.

To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
