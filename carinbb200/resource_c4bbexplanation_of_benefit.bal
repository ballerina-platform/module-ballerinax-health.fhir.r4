# FHIR C4BBExplanationOfBenefit resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + benefitPeriod - The term of the benefits documented in this response.
# + insurance - Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and services specified on the claim.
# + claimResponse - The business identifier for the instance of the adjudication response: claim, predetermination or preauthorization response.
# + use - A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be provided in the future.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + preAuthRef - Reference from the Insurer which is used in later communications which refers to this adjudication.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - The category of claim, e.g. oral, pharmacy, vision, institutional, professional.
# + precedence - This indicates the relative order of a series of EOBs related to different coverages for the same suite of services.
# + processNote - A note that describes or explains adjudication results in a human readable form.
# + payee - The party to be reimbursed for cost of the products and services according to the terms of the policy.
# + supportingInfo - Additional information codes regarding exceptions, special considerations, the condition, situation, prior or concurrent issues.
# + claim - The business identifier for the instance of the adjudication request: claim predetermination or preauthorization.
# + enterer - Individual who created the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + payment - Payment details for the adjudication of the claim.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + careTeam - The members of the team who provided the products and services.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this explanation of benefit.
# * identifier Slicings

# + preAuthRefPeriod - The timeframe during which the supplied preauthorization reference may be quoted on claims to obtain the adjudication as provided.

# + status - The status of the resource instance.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + benefitBalance - Balance by Benefit Category.
# + accident - Details of a accident which resulted in injuries which required the products and services listed in the claim.
# + adjudication - The adjudication results which are presented at the header level rather than at the line-item or add-item levels.

Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + security - Security labels applied to this resource. These tags connect specific resources to the overall security policy and infrastructure.
# + versionId - The version specific identifier, as it appears in the version portion of the URL. This value changes when the resource is created, updated, or deleted.
# + profile - A list of profiles (references to [StructureDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition.html#) resources) that this resource claims to conform to. The URL is a reference to [StructureDefinition.url](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.url).

This provides a minimal amount of [Provenance](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/provenance.html#) information that can be used to track or differentiate the source of information in the resource. The source may identify another FHIR server, document, message, database, etc.
# + tag - Tags applied to this resource. Tags are intended to be used to identify and relate resources to process and workflow, and applications are not required to consider the tags when interpreting the meaning of a resource.

# + unitPrice - If the item is not a group then this is the fee for the product or service, otherwise this is the total of the fees for the details of the group.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + quantity - The number of repetitions of a service or product.
# + programCode - Identifies the program under which this may be recovered.
# + modifier - Item typification or modifiers codes to convey additional context for the product or service.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + productOrService - When the value is a group code then this item collects a set of related claim details, otherwise this contains the product, service, drug or other billing code for the item.
# + noteNumber - The numbers associated with notes below which apply to the adjudication of this item.
# + adjudication - The adjudication results.
# + sequence - A claim detail line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of sub-details which are simple items.
# + revenue - The type of revenue or cost center providing the product and/or service.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + udi - Unique Device Identifiers associated with this line item.
# + category - Code to identify the general type of benefits under which products and services are provided.
# + factor - A real number that represents a multiplier used in determining the overall value of services delivered and/or goods received. The concept of a Factor allows for a discount or surcharge multiplier to be applied to a monetary amount.
# + net - The quantity times the unit price for an additional service or product or charge.
