# FHIR DTRQuestionnaireResponse resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + authored - Identifies when this version of the answer set was created. Changes whenever the answers are updated.
# + identifier - A business identifier assigned to a particular completed (or partially completed) questionnaire.
# + partOf - A procedure or observation that this questionnaire was performed as part of the execution of. For example, the surgery a checklist was executed as part of.
# + extension - An Extension
# + item - A group or question item from the original questionnaire for which answers are provided.
# + questionnaire - The Questionnaire that defines and organizes the questions for which answers are being provided.
# + author - Person who received the answers to the questions in the QuestionnaireResponse and recorded them in the system.
# + subject - The subject of the questionnaire response. This could be a patient, organization, practitioner, device, etc. This is who/what the answers apply to, but is not necessarily the source of information.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this questionnaire response was created or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + 'source - The person who answered the questions about the subject.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + basedOn - The order, proposal or plan that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this QuestionnaireResponse. For example, a ServiceRequest seeking an intake assessment or a decision support recommendation to assess for post-partum depression.
# + status - The position of the questionnaire response within its overall lifecycle.
