# FHIR TestReport resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - Identifier for the TestScript assigned for external purposes outside the context of FHIR.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + test - A test executed from the test script.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + tester - Name of the tester producing this report (Organization or individual).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + participant - A participant in the test execution, either the execution engine, a client, or a server.
# + result - The overall result from the execution of the TestScript.
# + score - The final score (percentage of tests passed) resulting from the execution of the TestScript.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + testScript - Ideally this is an absolute URL that is used to identify the version-specific TestScript that was executed, matching the `TestScript.url`.
# + name - A free text natural language name identifying the executed TestScript.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + setup - The results of the series of required setup operations before the tests were executed.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + issued - When the TestScript was executed and this TestReport was generated.
# + teardown - The results of the series of operations required to clean up after all the tests were executed (successfully or otherwise).
# + status - The current state of this test report.
