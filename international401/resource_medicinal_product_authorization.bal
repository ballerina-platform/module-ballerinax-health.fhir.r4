# FHIR MedicinalProductAuthorization resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + statusDate - The date at which the given status has become applicable.
# + country - The country in which the marketing authorization has been granted.
# + identifier - Business identifier for the marketing authorization, as assigned by a regulator.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + dateOfFirstAuthorization - The date when the first authorization was granted by a Medicines Regulatory Agency.
# + subject - The medicinal product that is being authorized.
# + internationalBirthDate - Date of first marketing authorization for a company's new medicinal product in any country in the World.
# + jurisdiction - Jurisdiction within a country.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + legalBasis - The legal framework against which this authorization is granted.
# + holder - Marketing Authorization Holder.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + procedure - The regulatory procedure for granting or amending a marketing authorization.
# + jurisdictionalAuthorization - Authorization in areas within a country.
# + validityPeriod - The beginning of the time period in which the marketing authorization is in the specific status shall be specified A complete date consisting of day, month and year shall be specified using the ISO 8601 date format.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + dataExclusivityPeriod - A period of time after authorization before generic product applicatiosn can be submitted.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + regulator - Medicines Regulatory Agency.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + restoreDate - The date when a suspended the marketing or the marketing authorization of the product is anticipated to be restored.
# + status - The status of the marketing authorization.
