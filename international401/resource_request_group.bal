# FHIR RequestGroup resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Provides a mechanism to communicate additional information about the response.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - A code that identifies what the overall request group is.
# + subject - The subject for which the request group was created.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this request group.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + instantiatesUri - A URL referencing an externally defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this request.
# + action - The actions, if any, produced by the evaluation of the artifact.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - Describes the reason for the request group in coded or textual form.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + basedOn - A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this request.
# + identifier - Allows a service to provide a unique, business identifier for the request.
# + authoredOn - Indicates when the request group was created.
# + author - Provides a reference to the author of the request group.
# + replaces - Completed or terminated request(s) whose function is taken by this new request.
# + encounter - Describes the context of the request group, if any.
# + instantiatesCanonical - A canonical URL referencing a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this request.
# + priority - Indicates how quickly the request should be addressed with respect to other requests.
# + intent - Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the request and where the request fits into the workflow chain.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + groupIdentifier - A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the requisition, prescription or similar form.
# + status - The current state of the request. For request groups, the status reflects the status of all the requests in the group.
