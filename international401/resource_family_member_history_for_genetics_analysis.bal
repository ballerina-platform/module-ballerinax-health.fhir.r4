# FHIR Family_member_history_for_genetics_analysis resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + date - The date (and possibly time) when the family member history was recorded or last updated.
# + dataAbsentReason - Describes why the family member's history is not available.
# + note - This property allows a non condition-specific note to the made about the related person. Ideally, the note would be in the condition property, but this is not always possible.
# + extension - An Extension
# * extension Slicings
# 1) Extension: Mother(s) & Father(s) - genetic & other
#       - min = 0
#       - max = *
#
# 2) Extension: natural brother(s) & natural sister(s) - genetic & other
#       - min = 0
#       - max = *
#
# 3) Extension: Genetic markers, ethnicity, etc.
#       - min = 0
#       - max = *
#
# + AgeRange - The age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - Indicates a Condition, Observation, AllergyIntolerance, or QuestionnaireResponse that justifies this family member history event.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + instantiatesUri - The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this FamilyMemberHistory.
# + DeceasedAgeString - Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of death for the family member history record.
# + DeceasedAgeAge - Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of death for the family member history record.
# + DeceasedAgeRange - Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of death for the family member history record.
# + BornAgeDate - The actual or approximate date of birth of the relative.
# + DeceasedAgeDate - Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of death for the family member history record.
# + estimatedAge - If true, indicates that the age value specified is an estimated value.
# + patient - The person who this history concerns.
# + AgeString - The age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - Describes why the family member history occurred in coded or textual form.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this family member history by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + AgeAge - The age of the relative at the time the family member history is recorded.
# + instantiatesCanonical - The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this FamilyMemberHistory.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + DeceasedAgeBoolean - Deceased flag or the actual or approximate age of the relative at the time of death for the family member history record.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + name - This will either be a name or a description; e.g. 'Aunt Susan', 'my cousin with the red hair'.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + BornAgeString - The actual or approximate date of birth of the relative.
# + BornAgePeriod - The actual or approximate date of birth of the relative.
# + status - A code specifying the status of the record of the family history of a specific family member.

# + onsetAge - Either the age of onset, range of approximate age or descriptive string can be recorded. For conditions with multiple occurrences, this describes the first known occurrence.
# + outcome - Indicates what happened following the condition. If the condition resulted in death, deceased date is captured on the relation.
