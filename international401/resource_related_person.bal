# FHIR RelatedPerson resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - Identifier for a person within a particular scope.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + period - The period of time during which this relationship is or was active. If there are no dates defined, then the interval is unknown.
# + address - Address where the related person can be contacted or visited.
# + gender - Administrative Gender - the gender that the person is considered to have for administration and record keeping purposes.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + active - Whether this related person record is in active use.
# + photo - Image of the person.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + birthDate - The date on which the related person was born.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + patient - The patient this person is related to.
# + name - A name associated with the person.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + telecom - A contact detail for the person, e.g. a telephone number or an email address.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + communication - A language which may be used to communicate with about the patient's health.
# + relationship - The nature of the relationship between a patient and the related person.
