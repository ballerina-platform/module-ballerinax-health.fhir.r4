# FHIR Contract resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + friendly - The 'patient friendly language' versionof the Contract in whole or in parts. 'Patient friendly language' means the representation of the Contract and Contract Provisions in a manner that is readily accessible and understandable by a layperson in accordance with best practices for communication styles that ensure that those agreeing to or signing the Contract understand the roles, actions, obligations, responsibilities, and implication of the agreement.
# + subject - The target entity impacted by or of interest to parties to the agreement.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).

# + supportingInfo - Information that may be needed by/relevant to the performer in their execution of this term action.
# + topicReference - Narrows the range of legal concerns to focus on the achievement of specific contractual objectives.

# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + issued - When this Contract was issued.
# + contentDerivative - The minimal content derived from the basal information source at a specific stage in its lifecycle.
# + signer - Parties with legal standing in the Contract, including the principal parties, the grantor(s) and grantee(s), which are any person or organization bound by the contract, and any ancillary parties, which facilitate the execution of the contract such as a notary or witness.
# + identifier - Unique identifier for this Contract or a derivative that references a Source Contract.
# + expirationType - Event resulting in discontinuation or termination of this Contract instance by one or more parties to the contract.
# + legallyBindingAttachment - Legally binding Contract: This is the signed and legally recognized representation of the Contract, which is considered the 'source of truth' and which would be the basis for legal action related to enforcement of this Contract.
# + author - The individual or organization that authored the Contract definition, derivative, or instance in any legal state.
# + topicCodeableConcept - Narrows the range of legal concerns to focus on the achievement of specific contractual objectives.

# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + subType - Sub-category for the Contract that distinguishes the kinds of systems that would be interested in the Contract within the context of the Contract's scope.
# + legalState - Legal states of the formation of a legal instrument, which is a formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement.
