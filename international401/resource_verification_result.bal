# FHIR VerificationResult resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + statusDate - When the validation status was updated.
# + nextScheduled - The date when target is next validated, if appropriate.
# + primarySource - Information about the primary source(s) involved in validation.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + attestation - Information about the entity attesting to information.
# + failureAction - The result if validation fails (fatal; warning; record only; none).
# + need - The frequency with which the target must be validated (none; initial; periodic).
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + validationType - What the target is validated against (nothing; primary source; multiple sources).
# + validator - Information about the entity validating information.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + targetLocation - The fhirpath location(s) within the resource that was validated.
# + frequency - Frequency of revalidation.
# + target - A resource that was validated.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + lastPerformed - The date/time validation was last completed (including failed validations).
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + validationProcess - The primary process by which the target is validated (edit check; value set; primary source; multiple sources; standalone; in context).
# + status - The validation status of the target (attested; validated; in process; requires revalidation; validation failed; revalidation failed).

# + communicationMethod - Method for communicating with the primary source (manual; API; Push).
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + validationDate - When the target was validated against the primary source.
# + 'type - Type of primary source (License Board; Primary Education; Continuing Education; Postal Service; Relationship owner; Registration Authority; legal source; issuing source; authoritative source).
# + validationStatus - Status of the validation of the target against the primary source (successful; failed; unknown).
# + canPushUpdates - Ability of the primary source to push updates/alerts (yes; no; undetermined).
# + who - Reference to the primary source.
