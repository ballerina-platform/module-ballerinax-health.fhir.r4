# FHIR GroupDefinition resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + actual - If true, indicates that the resource refers to a specific group of real individuals. If false, the group defines a set of intended individuals.
# + identifier - A unique business identifier for this group.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - Provides a specific type of resource the group includes; e.g. 'cow', 'syringe', etc.
# + quantity - A count of the number of resource instances that are part of the group.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + active - Indicates whether the record for the group is available for use or is merely being retained for historical purposes.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - Identifies the broad classification of the kind of resources the group includes.
# + characteristic - Identifies traits whose presence r absence is shared by members of the group.
# + managingEntity - Entity responsible for defining and maintaining Group characteristics and/or registered members.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + member - Identifies the resource instances that are members of the group.
# + name - A label assigned to the group for human identification and communication.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
