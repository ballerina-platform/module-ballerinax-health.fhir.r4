# FHIR MedicationKnowledge resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - A code that specifies this medication, or a textual description if no code is available. Usage note: This could be a standard medication code such as a code from RxNorm, SNOMED CT, IDMP etc. It could also be a national or local formulary code, optionally with translations to other code systems.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + regulatory - Regulatory information about a medication.
# + medicineClassification - Categorization of the medication within a formulary or classification system.
# + associatedMedication - Associated or related medications. For example, if the medication is a branded product (e.g. Crestor), this is the Therapeutic Moeity (e.g. Rosuvastatin) or if this is a generic medication (e.g. Rosuvastatin), this would link to a branded product (e.g. Crestor).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + manufacturer - Describes the details of the manufacturer of the medication product. This is not intended to represent the distributor of a medication product.
# + synonym - Additional names for a medication, for example, the name(s) given to a medication in different countries. For example, acetaminophen and paracetamol or salbutamol and albuterol.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + relatedMedicationKnowledge - Associated or related knowledge about a medication.
# + productType - Category of the medication or product (e.g. branded product, therapeutic moeity, generic product, innovator product, etc.).
# + administrationGuidelines - Guidelines for the administration of the medication.
# + contraindication - Potential clinical issue with or between medication(s) (for example, drug-drug interaction, drug-disease contraindication, drug-allergy interaction, etc.).
# + amount - Specific amount of the drug in the packaged product. For example, when specifying a product that has the same strength (For example, Insulin glargine 100 unit per mL solution for injection), this attribute provides additional clarification of the package amount (For example, 3 mL, 10mL, etc.).
# + intendedRoute - The intended or approved route of administration.
# + cost - The price of the medication.
# + ingredient - Identifies a particular constituent of interest in the product.
# + preparationInstruction - The instructions for preparing the medication.
# + packaging - Information that only applies to packages (not products).
# + monitoringProgram - The program under which the medication is reviewed.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + drugCharacteristic - Specifies descriptive properties of the medicine, such as color, shape, imprints, etc.
# + doseForm - Describes the form of the item. Powder; tablets; capsule.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + monograph - Associated documentation about the medication.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + kinetics - The time course of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a medication from the body.
# + status - A code to indicate if the medication is in active use. The status refers to the validity about the information of the medication and not to its medicinal properties.

# + dosage - Dosage for the medication for the specific guidelines.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + 'type - The type of dosage (for example, prophylaxis, maintenance, therapeutic, etc.).
