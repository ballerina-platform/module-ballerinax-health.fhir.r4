# FHIR SupplyDelivery resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - Identifier for the supply delivery event that is used to identify it across multiple disparate systems.
# + partOf - A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + receiver - Identifies the person who picked up the Supply.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + destination - Identification of the facility/location where the Supply was shipped to, as part of the dispense event.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + occurrenceTiming - The date or time(s) the activity occurred.
# + 'type - Indicates the type of dispensing event that is performed. Examples include: Trial Fill, Completion of Trial, Partial Fill, Emergency Fill, Samples, etc.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + occurrencePeriod - The date or time(s) the activity occurred.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + patient - A link to a resource representing the person whom the delivered item is for.
# + supplier - The individual responsible for dispensing the medication, supplier or device.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + occurrenceDateTime - The date or time(s) the activity occurred.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + basedOn - A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.
# + suppliedItem - The item that is being delivered or has been supplied.
# + status - A code specifying the state of the dispense event.
