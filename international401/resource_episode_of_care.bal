# FHIR EpisodeOfCare resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - The EpisodeOfCare may be known by different identifiers for different contexts of use, such as when an external agency is tracking the Episode for funding purposes.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + period - The interval during which the managing organization assumes the defined responsibility.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + diagnosis - The list of diagnosis relevant to this episode of care.
# + careManager - The practitioner that is the care manager/care coordinator for this patient.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + team - The list of practitioners that may be facilitating this episode of care for specific purposes.
# + 'type - A classification of the type of episode of care; e.g. specialist referral, disease management, type of funded care.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + statusHistory - The history of statuses that the EpisodeOfCare has been through (without requiring processing the history of the resource).
# + managingOrganization - The organization that has assumed the specific responsibilities for the specified duration.
# + referralRequest - Referral Request(s) that are fulfilled by this EpisodeOfCare, incoming referrals.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + patient - The patient who is the focus of this episode of care.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + account - The set of accounts that may be used for billing for this EpisodeOfCare.
# + status - planned | waitlist | active | onhold | finished | cancelled.
