# FHIR SupplyRequest resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + deliverFrom - Where the supply is expected to come from.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - The reason why the supply item was requested.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + deliverTo - Where the supply is destined to go.
# + itemCodeableConcept - The item that is requested to be supplied. This is either a link to a resource representing the details of the item or a code that identifies the item from a known list.
# + 'parameter - Specific parameters for the ordered item. For example, the size of the indicated item.
# + supplier - Who is intended to fulfill the request.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - The reason why the supply item was requested.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + requester - The device, practitioner, etc. who initiated the request.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this SupplyRequest by the author and/or other systems. These identifiers remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + authoredOn - When the request was made.
# + quantity - The amount that is being ordered of the indicated item.
# + occurrenceTiming - When the request should be fulfilled.
# + priority - Indicates how quickly this SupplyRequest should be addressed with respect to other requests.
# + itemReference - The item that is requested to be supplied. This is either a link to a resource representing the details of the item or a code that identifies the item from a known list.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + occurrencePeriod - When the request should be fulfilled.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + occurrenceDateTime - When the request should be fulfilled.
# + category - Category of supply, e.g. central, non-stock, etc. This is used to support work flows associated with the supply process.
# + status - Status of the supply request.
