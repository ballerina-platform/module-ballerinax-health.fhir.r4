# FHIR Consent resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + dateTime - When this Consent was issued / created / indexed.
# + sourceReference - The source on which this consent statement is based. The source might be a scanned original paper form, or a reference to a consent that links back to such a source, a reference to a document repository (e.g. XDS) that stores the original consent document.
# + identifier - Unique identifier for this copy of the Consent Statement.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + performer - Either the Grantor, which is the entity responsible for granting the rights listed in a Consent Directive or the Grantee, which is the entity responsible for complying with the Consent Directive, including any obligations or limitations on authorizations and enforcement of prohibitions.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + sourceAttachment - The source on which this consent statement is based. The source might be a scanned original paper form, or a reference to a consent that links back to such a source, a reference to a document repository (e.g. XDS) that stores the original consent document.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + policyRule - A reference to the specific base computable regulation or policy.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + patient - The patient/healthcare consumer to whom this consent applies.
# + provision - An exception to the base policy of this consent. An exception can be an addition or removal of access permissions.
# + organization - The organization that manages the consent, and the framework within which it is executed.
# + scope - A selector of the type of consent being presented: ADR, Privacy, Treatment, Research. This list is now extensible.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + category - A classification of the type of consents found in the statement. This element supports indexing and retrieval of consent statements.
# + verification - Whether a treatment instruction (e.g. artificial respiration yes or no) was verified with the patient, his/her family or another authorized person.
# + policy - The references to the policies that are included in this consent scope. Policies may be organizational, but are often defined jurisdictionally, or in law.
# + status - Indicates the current state of this consent.
