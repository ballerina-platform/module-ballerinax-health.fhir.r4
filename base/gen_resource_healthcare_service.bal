# FHIR HealthcareService resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + serviceProvisionCode - The code(s) that detail the conditions under which the healthcare service is available/offered.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + specialty - Collection of specialties handled by the service site. This is more of a medical term.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + eligibility - Does this service have specific eligibility requirements that need to be met in order to use the service?
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + program - Programs that this service is applicable to.
# + 'type - The specific type of service that may be delivered or performed.
# + characteristic - Collection of characteristics (attributes).
# + notAvailable - The HealthcareService is not available during this period of time due to the provided reason.
# + availableTime - A collection of times that the Service Site is available.
# + endpoint - Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the specific healthcare services defined at this resource.
# + telecom - List of contacts related to this specific healthcare service.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + communication - Some services are specifically made available in multiple languages, this property permits a directory to declare the languages this is offered in. Typically this is only provided where a service operates in communities with mixed languages used.
# + referralMethod - Ways that the service accepts referrals, if this is not provided then it is implied that no referral is required.
# + providedBy - The organization that provides this healthcare service.
# + identifier - External identifiers for this item.
# + appointmentRequired - Indicates whether or not a prospective consumer will require an appointment for a particular service at a site to be provided by the Organization. Indicates if an appointment is required for access to this service.
# + active - This flag is used to mark the record to not be used. This is not used when a center is closed for maintenance, or for holidays, the notAvailable period is to be used for this.
# + photo - If there is a photo/symbol associated with this HealthcareService, it may be included here to facilitate quick identification of the service in a list.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + name - Further description of the service as it would be presented to a consumer while searching.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + comment - Any additional description of the service and/or any specific issues not covered by the other attributes, which can be displayed as further detail under the serviceName.
# + location - The location(s) where this healthcare service may be provided.
# + category - Identifies the broad category of service being performed or delivered.
# + extraDetails - Extra details about the service that can't be placed in the other fields.
# + availabilityExceptions - A description of site availability exceptions, e.g. public holiday availability. Succinctly describing all possible exceptions to normal site availability as details in the available Times and not available Times.
# + coverageArea - The location(s) that this service is available to (not where the service is provided).

Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

# + daysOfWeek - Indicates which days of the week are available between the start and end Times.
# + availableStartTime - The opening time of day. Note: If the AllDay flag is set, then this time is ignored.
