# FHIR Media resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Comments made about the media by the performer, subject or other participants.
# + partOf - A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + modality - Details of the type of the media - usually, how it was acquired (what type of device). If images sourced from a DICOM system, are wrapped in a Media resource, then this is the modality.
# + subject - Who/What this Media is a record of.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + createdDateTime - The date and time(s) at which the media was collected.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - A code that classifies whether the media is an image, video or audio recording or some other media category.
# + deviceName - The name of the device / manufacturer of the device that was used to make the recording.
# + content - The actual content of the media - inline or by direct reference to the media source file.
# + operator - The person who administered the collection of the image.
# + duration - The duration of the recording in seconds - for audio and video.
# + view - The name of the imaging view e.g. Lateral or Antero-posterior (AP).
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + issued - The date and time this version of the media was made available to providers, typically after having been reviewed.
# + basedOn - A procedure that is fulfilled in whole or in part by the creation of this media.
# + height - Height of the image in pixels (photo/video).
# + identifier - Identifiers associated with the image - these may include identifiers for the image itself, identifiers for the context of its collection (e.g. series ids) and context ids such as accession numbers or other workflow identifiers.
# + frames - The number of frames in a photo. This is used with a multi-page fax, or an imaging acquisition context that takes multiple slices in a single image, or an animated gif. If there is more than one frame, this SHALL have a value in order to alert interface software that a multi-frame capable rendering widget is required.
# + encounter - The encounter that establishes the context for this media.
# + createdPeriod - The date and time(s) at which the media was collected.
# + bodySite - Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e. the target site).
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + width - Width of the image in pixels (photo/video).
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + device - The device used to collect the media.
# + status - The current state of the {{title}}.
