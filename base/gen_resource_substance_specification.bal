# FHIR SubstanceSpecification resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + polymer - Data items specific to polymers.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - Codes associated with the substance.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + description - Textual description of the substance.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'source - Supporting literature.
# + 'type - High level categorization, e.g. polymer or nucleic acid.
# + moiety - Moiety, for structural modifications.
# + protein - Data items specific to proteins.
# + property - General specifications for this substance, including how it is related to other substances.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + relationship - A link between this substance and another, with details of the relationship.
# + identifier - Identifier by which this substance is known.
# + referenceInformation - General information detailing this substance.
# + structure - Structural information.
# + sourceMaterial - Material or taxonomic/anatomical source for the substance.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + nucleicAcid - Data items specific to nucleic acids.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + domain - If the substance applies to only human or veterinary use.
# + name - Names applicable to this substance.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + comment - Textual comment about this record of a substance.
# + status - Status of substance within the catalogue e.g. approved.

# FHIR SubstanceSpecificationRelationship datatype record.
#
# + amountRatio - A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some other.
# + amountType - An operator for the amount, for example 'average', 'approximately', 'less than'.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + substanceCodeableConcept - A pointer to another substance, as a resource or just a representational code.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + 'source - Supporting literature.
# + amountRatioLowLimit - For use when the numeric.
# + isDefining - For example where an enzyme strongly bonds with a particular substance, this is a defining relationship for that enzyme, out of several possible substance relationships.
# + amountQuantity - A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some other.
# + amountString - A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some other.
# + amountRange - A numeric factor for the relationship, for instance to express that the salt of a substance has some percentage of the active substance in relation to some other.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + relationship - For example 'salt to parent', 'active moiety', 'starting material'.
# + substanceReference - A pointer to another substance, as a resource or just a representational code.

Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + role - Role that the moiety is playing.
# + amountString - Quantitative value for this moiety.
# + opticalActivity - Optical activity type.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + molecularFormula - Molecular formula.
# + name - Textual name for this moiety substance.
# + stereochemistry - Stereochemistry type.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
