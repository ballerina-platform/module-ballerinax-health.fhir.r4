# FHIR Claim resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + insurance - Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and services specified on the claim.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + use - A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be provided in the future.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - The category of claim, e.g. oral, pharmacy, vision, institutional, professional.
# + accident - Details of an accident which resulted in injuries which required the products and services listed in the claim.
# + payee - The party to be reimbursed for cost of the products and services according to the terms of the policy.
# + total - The total value of the all the items in the claim.
# + related - Other claims which are related to this claim such as prior submissions or claims for related services or for the same event.
# + supportingInfo - Additional information codes regarding exceptions, special considerations, the condition, situation, prior or concurrent issues.
# + fundsReserve - A code to indicate whether and for whom funds are to be reserved for future claims.
# + provider - The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + insurer - The Insurer who is target of the request.
# + patient - The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied or are being considered and for whom actual or forecast reimbursement is sought.
# + enterer - Individual who created the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + careTeam - The members of the team who provided the products and services.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this claim.
# + item - A claim line. Either a simple product or service or a 'group' of details which can each be a simple items or groups of sub-details.
# + created - The date this resource was created.
# + diagnosis - Information about diagnoses relevant to the claim items.
# + originalPrescription - Original prescription which has been superseded by this prescription to support the dispensing of pharmacy services, medications or products.
# + procedure - Procedures performed on the patient relevant to the billing items with the claim.
# + priority - The provider-required urgency of processing the request. Typical values include: stat, routine deferred.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + referral - A reference to a referral resource.
# + prescription - Prescription to support the dispensing of pharmacy, device or vision products.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + billablePeriod - The period for which charges are being submitted.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + subType - A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
# + facility - Facility where the services were provided.
# + status - The status of the resource instance.

# + subDetail - A claim detail line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of sub-details which are simple items.
# + productOrService - When the value is a group code then this item collects a set of related claim details, otherwise this contains the product, service, drug or other billing code for the item.
# + sequence - A number to uniquely identify item entries.
# + revenue - The type of revenue or cost center providing the product and/or service.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + udi - Unique Device Identifiers associated with this line item.
# + category - Code to identify the general type of benefits under which products and services are provided.
# + factor - A real number that represents a multiplier used in determining the overall value of services delivered and/or goods received. The concept of a Factor allows for a discount or surcharge multiplier to be applied to a monetary amount.
# + net - The quantity times the unit price for an additional service or product or charge.

# FHIR ClaimInsurance datatype record.
#
# + coverage - Reference to the insurance card level information contained in the Coverage resource. The coverage issuing insurer will use these details to locate the patient's actual coverage within the insurer's information system.
# + identifier - The business identifier to be used when the claim is sent for adjudication against this insurance policy.
# + sequence - A number to uniquely identify insurance entries and provide a sequence of coverages to convey coordination of benefit order.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + businessArrangement - A business agreement number established between the provider and the insurer for special business processing purposes.
# + claimResponse - The result of the adjudication of the line items for the Coverage specified in this insurance.
# + focal - A flag to indicate that this Coverage is to be used for adjudication of this claim when set to true.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + preAuthRef - Reference numbers previously provided by the insurer to the provider to be quoted on subsequent claims containing services or products related to the prior authorization.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
