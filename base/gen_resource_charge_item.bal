# FHIR ChargeItem resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Comments made about the event by the performer, subject or other participants.
# + partOf - ChargeItems can be grouped to larger ChargeItems covering the whole set.
# + reason - Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.
# + definitionCanonical - References the source of pricing information, rules of application for the code this ChargeItem uses.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - A code that identifies the charge, like a billing code.
# + subject - The individual or set of individuals the action is being or was performed on.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + overrideReason - If the list price or the rule-based factor associated with the code is overridden, this attribute can capture a text to indicate the reason for this action.
# + productReference - Identifies the device, food, drug or other product being charged either by type code or reference to an instance.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + definitionUri - References the (external) source of pricing information, rules of application for the code this ChargeItem uses.
# + performingOrganization - The organization requesting the service.
# + context - The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this event.
# + enterer - The device, practitioner, etc. who entered the charge item.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + factorOverride - Factor overriding the factor determined by the rules associated with the code.
# + identifier - Identifiers assigned to this event performer or other systems.
# + bodysite - The anatomical location where the related service has been applied.
# + performer - Indicates who or what performed or participated in the charged service.
# + quantity - Quantity of which the charge item has been serviced.
# + costCenter - The financial cost center permits the tracking of charge attribution.
# + enteredDate - Date the charge item was entered.
# + priceOverride - Total price of the charge overriding the list price associated with the code.
# + supportingInformation - Further information supporting this charge.
# + occurrenceTiming - Date/time(s) or duration when the charged service was applied.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + occurrencePeriod - Date/time(s) or duration when the charged service was applied.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + 'service - Indicated the rendered service that caused this charge.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + occurrenceDateTime - Date/time(s) or duration when the charged service was applied.
# + requestingOrganization - The organization performing the service.
# + account - Account into which this ChargeItems belongs.
# + productCodeableConcept - Identifies the device, food, drug or other product being charged either by type code or reference to an instance.
# + status - The current state of the ChargeItem.
