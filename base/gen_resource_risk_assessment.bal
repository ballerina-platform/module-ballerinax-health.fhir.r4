# FHIR RiskAssessment resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Additional comments about the risk assessment.
# + parent - A reference to a resource that this risk assessment is part of, such as a Procedure.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - The type of the risk assessment performed.
# + subject - The patient or group the risk assessment applies to.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - Resources supporting the reason the risk assessment was performed.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - The reason the risk assessment was performed.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + basedOn - A reference to the request that is fulfilled by this risk assessment.
# + identifier - Business identifier assigned to the risk assessment.
# + mitigation - A description of the steps that might be taken to reduce the identified risk(s).
# + performer - The provider or software application that performed the assessment.
# + method - The algorithm, process or mechanism used to evaluate the risk.
# + encounter - The encounter where the assessment was performed.
# + basis - Indicates the source data considered as part of the assessment (for example, FamilyHistory, Observations, Procedures, Conditions, etc.).
# + condition - For assessments or prognosis specific to a particular condition, indicates the condition being assessed.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + occurrencePeriod - The date (and possibly time) the risk assessment was performed.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + prediction - Describes the expected outcome for the subject.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + occurrenceDateTime - The date (and possibly time) the risk assessment was performed.
# + status - The status of the RiskAssessment, using the same statuses as an Observation.
