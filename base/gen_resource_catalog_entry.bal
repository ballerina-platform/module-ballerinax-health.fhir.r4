# FHIR CatalogEntry resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + additionalClassification - User for example for ATC classification, or.
# + identifier - Used in supporting different identifiers for the same product, e.g. manufacturer code and retailer code.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + relatedEntry - Used for example, to point to a substance, or to a device used to administer a medication.
# + orderable - Whether the entry represents an orderable item.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + additionalIdentifier - Used in supporting related concepts, e.g. NDC to RxNorm.
# + classification - Classes of devices, or ATC for medication.
# + 'type - The type of item - medication, device, service, protocol or other.
# + validityPeriod - The time period in which this catalog entry is expected to be active.
# + lastUpdated - Typically date of issue is different from the beginning of the validity. This can be used to see when an item was last updated.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + additionalCharacteristic - Used for examplefor Out of Formulary, or any specifics.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + referencedItem - The item in a catalog or definition.
# + status - Used to support catalog exchange even for unsupported products, e.g. getting list of medications even if not prescribable.
# + validTo - The date until which this catalog entry is expected to be active.
