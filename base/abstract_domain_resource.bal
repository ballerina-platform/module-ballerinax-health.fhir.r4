# A resource with narrative, extensions, and contained resources.
#   * Rule: If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources.
#   * Rule: If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL be referred to from elsewhere in the resource or SHALL refer to the containing resource
#   * Rule: If a resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT have a meta.versionId or a meta.lastUpdated.
#   * Rule: If a resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT have a security label.
#   * Guideline: A resource should have narrative for robust management.
#
# + text - Text summary of the resource, for human interpretation
# + contained - Contained, inline Resources
# + extension - Additional content defined by implementations
# + modifierExtension - Extensions that cannot be ignored
