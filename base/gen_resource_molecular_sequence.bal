# FHIR MolecularSequence resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - A unique identifier for this particular sequence instance. This is a FHIR-defined id.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + pointer - Pointer to next atomic sequence which at most contains one variant.
# + performer - The organization or lab that should be responsible for this result.
# + quantity - The number of copies of the sequence of interest. (RNASeq).
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + observedSeq - Sequence that was observed. It is the result marked by referenceSeq along with variant records on referenceSeq. This shall start from referenceSeq.windowStart and end by referenceSeq.windowEnd.
# + repository - Configurations of the external repository. The repository shall store target's observedSeq or records related with target's observedSeq.
# + 'type - Amino Acid Sequence/ DNA Sequence / RNA Sequence.
# + quality - An experimental feature attribute that defines the quality of the feature in a quantitative way, such as a phred quality score ([SO:0001686](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001686)).
# + structureVariant - Information about chromosome structure variation.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + patient - The patient whose sequencing results are described by this resource.
# + readCoverage - Coverage (read depth or depth) is the average number of reads representing a given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence.
# + specimen - Specimen used for sequencing.
# + variant - The definition of variant here originates from Sequence ontology ([variant_of](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/variant_of)). This element can represent amino acid or nucleic sequence change(including insertion,deletion,SNP,etc.) It can represent some complex mutation or segment variation with the assist of CIGAR string.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + coordinateSystem - Whether the sequence is numbered starting at 0 (0-based numbering or coordinates, inclusive start, exclusive end) or starting at 1 (1-based numbering, inclusive start and inclusive end).
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + device - The method for sequencing, for example, chip information.
# + referenceSeq - A sequence that is used as a reference to describe variants that are present in a sequence analyzed.

To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

# + 'start - Start position of the variant on the reference sequence. If the coordinate system is either 0-based or 1-based, then start position is inclusive.
# + end - End position of the variant on the reference sequence. If the coordinate system is 0-based then end is exclusive and does not include the last position. If the coordinate system is 1-base, then end is inclusive and includes the last position.
# + observedAllele - An allele is one of a set of coexisting sequence variants of a gene ([SO:0001023](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001023)). Nucleotide(s)/amino acids from start position of sequence to stop position of sequence on the positive (+) strand of the observed sequence. When the sequence type is DNA, it should be the sequence on the positive (+) strand. This will lay in the range between variant.start and variant.end.

# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + variantPointer - A pointer to an Observation containing variant information.

# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + orientation - A relative reference to a DNA strand based on gene orientation. The strand that contains the open reading frame of the gene is the 'sense' strand, and the opposite complementary strand is the 'antisense' strand.
# + strand - An absolute reference to a strand. The Watson strand is the strand whose 5'-end is on the short arm of the chromosome, and the Crick strand as the one whose 5'-end is on the long arm.
# + referenceSeqString - A string like 'ACGT'.
# + windowStart - Start position of the window on the reference sequence. If the coordinate system is either 0-based or 1-based, then start position is inclusive.
# + genomeBuild - The Genome Build used for reference, following GRCh build versions e.g. 'GRCh 37'. Version number must be included if a versioned release of a primary build was used.
# + chromosome - Structural unit composed of a nucleic acid molecule which controls its own replication through the interaction of specific proteins at one or more origins of replication ([SO:0000340](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0000340)).
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions.

# + windowEnd - End position of the window on the reference sequence. If the coordinate system is 0-based then end is exclusive and does not include the last position. If the coordinate system is 1-base, then end is inclusive and includes the last position.
# + referenceSeqPointer - A pointer to another MolecularSequence entity as reference sequence.
# + referenceSeqId - Reference identifier of reference sequence submitted to NCBI. It must match the type in the MolecularSequence.type field. For example, the prefix, “NG_” identifies reference sequence for genes, “NM_” for messenger RNA transcripts, and “NP_” for amino acid sequences.
