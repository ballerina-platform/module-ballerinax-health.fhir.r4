# FHIR InsurancePlan resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + coverage - Details about the coverage offered by the insurance product.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this health insurance product which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + period - The period of time that the health insurance product is available.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + administeredBy - An organization which administer other services such as underwriting, customer service and/or claims processing on behalf of the health insurance product owner.
# + 'type - The kind of health insurance product.
# + network - Reference to the network included in the health insurance product.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + endpoint - The technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the health insurance product.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + contact - The contact for the health insurance product for a certain purpose.
# + name - Official name of the health insurance product as designated by the owner.
# + alias - A list of alternate names that the product is known as, or was known as in the past.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + ownedBy - The entity that is providing the health insurance product and underwriting the risk. This is typically an insurance carriers, other third-party payers, or health plan sponsors comonly referred to as 'payers'.
# + plan - Details about an insurance plan.
# + coverageArea - The geographic region in which a health insurance product's benefits apply.
# + status - The current state of the health insurance product.
