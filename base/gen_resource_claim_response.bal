# FHIR ClaimResponse resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + insurance - Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and services specified on the claim.
# + request - Original request resource reference.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + use - A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be provided in the future.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + payeeType - Type of Party to be reimbursed: subscriber, provider, other.
# + preAuthRef - Reference from the Insurer which is used in later communications which refers to this adjudication.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'error - Errors encountered during the processing of the adjudication.
# + 'type - A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
# + processNote - A note that describes or explains adjudication results in a human readable form.
# + addItem - The first-tier service adjudications for payor added product or service lines.
# + total - Categorized monetary totals for the adjudication.
# + fundsReserve - A code, used only on a response to a preauthorization, to indicate whether the benefits payable have been reserved and for whom.
# + insurer - The party responsible for authorization, adjudication and reimbursement.
# + patient - The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied or are being considered and for whom actual for facast reimbursement is sought.
# + communicationRequest - Request for additional supporting or authorizing information.
# + payment - Payment details for the adjudication of the claim.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + outcome - The outcome of the claim, predetermination, or preauthorization processing.
# + identifier - A unique identifier assigned to this claim response.
# + item - A claim line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of details which can also be a simple items or groups of sub-details.
# + preAuthPeriod - The time frame during which this authorization is effective.
# + formCode - A code for the form to be used for printing the content.
# + created - The date this resource was created.
# + requestor - The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + disposition - A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.
# + form - The actual form, by reference or inclusion, for printing the content or an EOB.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + subType - A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
# + status - The status of the resource instance.
