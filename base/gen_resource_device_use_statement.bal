# FHIR DeviceUseStatement resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + identifier - An external identifier for this statement such as an IRI.
# + note - Details about the device statement that were not represented at all or sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + timingTiming - How often the device was used.
# + timingPeriod - How often the device was used.
# + subject - The patient who used the device.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + reasonReference - Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this DeviceUseStatement.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'source - Who reported the device was being used by the patient.
# + bodySite - Indicates the anotomic location on the subject's body where the device was used ( i.e. the target).
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + derivedFrom - Allows linking the DeviceUseStatement to the underlying Request, or to other information that supports or is used to derive the DeviceUseStatement.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + recordedOn - The time at which the statement was made/recorded.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + reasonCode - Reason or justification for the use of the device.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + device - The details of the device used.
# + basedOn - A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this DeviceUseStatement.
# + status - A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of the device used that this statement is about. Generally this will be active or completed.
# + timingDateTime - How often the device was used.
